    Hi, I am [flofriday](https://github.com/flofriday), the creator of this bot.
    Unfortunately, this bot saves some userdata. However, I promise that I will 
    *never sell* this *data* to anybody. Moreover, I promise you that I will never
    use any userdata to enrich myself in anyway.

    *-- So why do you even collect any data? --*
    First, some functionality is not possible without any userdata. For example
    the email-less suggestion feature. Also I want to know whats going on my bot
    therefore I created the /statistics command. I promise that every analytics 
    tool for this bot will be available to all users, so everybody knows as much
    as I do.

    *-- What exactly do you collect) --*
    Since the first time u used the bot I saved your telegram id with a counter 
    of how many interactions you had with the bot. I do not save what you wrote 
    the bot, what you received from the bot nor when you wrote the bot. Also I 
    promise that I will never use those ids to contact you personally (I am not
    even sure if that would be possible). 
    In the case you write a suggestion, I will save your telegram username along
    the suggestion text. With that I can (and in rare cases might) contact you 
    to discuss your suggestion.
